# wip-mt-node-gateway-lib

This app modularizes the primary Major Tom gateway functions: communicating with Major Tom over a WebSocket connection and communicating with Major Tom over a REST connection.

The WebSocket and REST connections to Major Tom are accessible through `index.js`.

`example-app.js` is an example implementation of using the library with a bare bones node interface.

`example/temp-server.js` allows you to run a localhost server that allows a user to take some rudimentary actions.  It's built on top of `example/example-app.js`, but it probably could just talk to `index.js` directly too.

### You Can Start a Major Tom Gateway Right from the Node REPL

```javascript
const new_gateway = require('./index.js');

const my_gateway = new_gateway();

// my_gateway is now an instance of Major Tom Node Gateway
my_gateway.connect_to_mt('wss://you.majortom.cloud', '<my gateway token>');
// If your instance of you.majortom.cloud is protected by basic auth, pass
// username and password as the third and fourth args to connect_to_mt()

// This gateway is now connected to Major Tom.  Tell it what to do when it
// receives a message from Major Tom:
my_gateway.on_mt_message(console.log);
// Very simple; just log the message to console

// Now we can send a message to Major Tom
const first_message = {
  type: 'events',
  events: [{
    type: 'Greeting',
    message: 'Hello from the Node REPL',
  }]
};
const first_message_string = JSON.stringify(first_message);

my_gateway.to_mt(first_message_string);

// Now if you check your Major Tom Events UI, you should see the message was
// received from this gateway.

// Let's upload a file from the file system to Major Tom.  First get a file as a
// Buffer from the file system:
const fs = require('fs');
const my_file_buffer = fs.readFileSync('path/to/my_file');

// This library expects the file as a Buffer, the file name (as a string) to
// display in the Major Tom UI, and the System name (a string) that this file is
// associated with:
my_gateway.upload_file_to_mt(my_file_buffer, 'My File', 'Any_System');

// Now if you check your Major Tom Mission Files UI, you should see this file
// available for download to your machine.
```

### Connecting to Systems

Every Mission may have unique architecture; this library focuses solely on communication between your Gateway solution and Major Tom.  Connecting to systems could be done in various ways.  See the `ðŸ“‚examples` folder for one solution to connecting to a set of test systems.
